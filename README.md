●	What did you like about this project?
Nothing. I just caught up understanding the basics of Java (classes, objects, methods, access specifiers, constructor etc.), and grasp some of the concepts by with exercises creating simple programs (Road Toll Fees, Currency Converter, BMI Calculator, Bank Account, Salary Bonus etc.), and I'm hit with the project with so many classes and objects to be piece together. I'm not at this stage yet. I barely got out of the 1st level of understanding hours before this assessment. 
●	What did you struggle with in this project?
I just for to understanding the basics of Java, through exercises creating simple programs. I defined the objects, variables with my own naming convention. Step by step creating each class, before moving on to the next. Facing the whole codes and trying to figure out where it started, what is means, at this stage, is impossible. I do hope that after completing the UDEMY Java course, I'll be able to. 
●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Time. Not longer time for the assessment. Time to study, absorb, and understand everything.
